This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## ToDo

- [x] antd babel plugin plugin
- [x] pre-commit hook (husky, lint-staged)
- [x] antd style customization
- [ ] emotion plugin
- [ ] config for test env
- [ ] check https://github.com/sharegate/craco

This shouldn't work since react-app-rewired is supossed to not work with CRA 2.0/react-scripts >= 2.X, but for now it's working

## current gains

- react-scripts 2.X features
  - css/scss modules support
- antd style customization by variables (should also work with 1.0)
